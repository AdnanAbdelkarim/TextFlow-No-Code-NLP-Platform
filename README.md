# 🧠 Text Analysis Dashboard

An interactive and modular web application built using **Flask** for performing comprehensive **text analysis** on labeled datasets. The dashboard supports core Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as frequency analysis, word clouds, sentiment scoring, keyword extraction, and predictive modeling.

> 👨‍🔬 This project was developed as part of an academic research initiative under the supervision of **Dr. Uzair Ahmed**, with implementation and development led by **Adnan Abdelkarim** as a **Research Assistant**. It is currently under consideration for **publication** and potential **productization**.

## 🚀 Features

- 📂 Upload `.csv` or `.txt` files with labeled text data  
- 📊 Word frequency, Zipf's Law plot, and word co-occurrence network  
- 🔍 Named Entity Recognition (NER)  
- ☁️ Word cloud generation with stopword removal  
- 📈 Sentiment analysis using AFINN  
- 🧠 Predictive modeling using Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and KNN  
- 📉 Confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve visualization  
- 🧪 Type I and Type II error breakdown (binary classification only)  
- 💡 TF-IDF vectorization support *(available for Logistic Regression and KNN models only)*
- 🛠️ Modular Flask backend and clearly separated utilities
